# z-control Backup Scripts 🚀

Welcome to the **z-control Backup Scripts** repository! This project contains a collection of PowerShell and batch scripts designed to automate and streamline the backup process for development environments. Whether you're looking to back up your code, configurations, or other important files, these scripts provide a solid foundation to get you started.

> **Note:**  
Normally, a project is committed to GitHub or another backup service. However, for cases like simple tests, examples, or temporary projects, these scripts can help you remove unwanted large folders (such as dependencies and build outputs) and copy a lean version of your projects to a folder that is automatically synchronized with a service like OneDrive.

There are also scripts available to log disk space usage within specified directories, helping you monitor and manage your storage effectively.
